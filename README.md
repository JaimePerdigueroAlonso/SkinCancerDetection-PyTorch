Skin Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning

1. Introduction

This project implements a deep learning model for skin cancer detection, classifying images as either benign or malignant. It utilizes the PyTorch library to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the ResNet18 architecture. The dataset used is the "Melanoma Skin Cancer Dataset of 10000 images" available on Kaggle.
